Project 01 â€“ Around the World!

Repo Name: Project 01 Around the World!

Your first project is a review project. You will create a 3D space game with a spaceship that can fly 
around. However, the space ship should not be able to leave the solar system!

You should have the sun and all the planets of this solar system. The planets should orbit around the sun 
at different, designer-changeable rates. The earth should include its moon. 

The spaceship should propel forward on its own, with the player being unable to stop the ship. 

If the spaceship collides with a planet, it should be destroyed and a destroyed animation should play. 

If the spaceship is destroyed, the player should be prompted to press the spacebar to continue or 
the escape key to quit. If the player presses the spacebar to continue, their position should reset to the 
start. Then a 5 second (designer-variable) countdown should ensue (which the player should be able to 
see). After the countdown ends, the player should begin moving again. 

Feel free to add any additional features your team wants. However, if new features are added each 
team member must each add a feature!
